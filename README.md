# Week_6_project
# Problem statement
The primary goals are to improve user engagement and increase the completion rate of the process. Specifically, Vanguard aims to determine if the new design leads to a higher completion rate and lower error rate while also considering the cost-effectiveness of the new design implementation.
# Hypotheses
I have formulated several hypotheses to test various aspects of the new design's effectiveness
Completion Rate Hypotheses
Error Rate Hypotheses
Average time spent on each step
Cost-Effectiveness Hypotheses
Demographics Hypotheses
# Timeline
The experiment was conducted from March 15, 2017, to June 20, 2017.
# Key Components
Control Group: This group interacted with the traditional online process.
Test Group: This group interacted with the new, enhanced digital interface.
Process Sequence:

# Data Wrangling
Checking for null values : df.isnull().sum()
Handling missing values : df= fill na ()
Checking for duplicates: df.duplicated()
String formatting: df.rename()
# Challenges
Data Quality and Cleaning
Data Integration
Multiple sessions
Back tracking
Library Deprecations
# Learnings
Importance of Data cleaning
Derived metrics
Statistical testing
Updated libraries
# Recommendations & conclusion
Combining or reducing the number of process steps which could reduce error rate
